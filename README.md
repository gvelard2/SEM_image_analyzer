# SEM_image_analyzer
ipynb to analyze vertical lithography lines of SEM images at various landing energies

This notebook walks through how to analyze and quantify the line-space metric of an electron-beam photolithography pattern collected via SEM.  
This notebook will act as the foundation for future .py automated scripts to handle high-throughput analysis.  
<br> The images provided are snipped from the publication "Gian Francesco Lorusso et al 2023 Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 62 SG0808"  
<br> Due to the resolution reduction of this image, the image quality simulates empirical noise and environments more closely.  
<br> Each image is taken at the indicated landing energy (inset eV) during the e-beam lithography process
